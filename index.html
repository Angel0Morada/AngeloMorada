								<p style="text-align: justify;">As a student of ITC-C508, I expect to gain a strong understanding of how advanced machine learning models are developed to perform complex tasks autonomously. The initial readings introduced me to how businesses today are leveraging Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), 
									and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate operations, improve productivity, and enhance decision-making. I am especially excited to learn how advanced neural networks such as feedforward and recurrent models are trained and optimized to perform predictions or language-related tasks using large volumes of data. 
									For example, real-world tools like Salesforce’s Einstein for sales optimization and DigitalGenius for customer service demonstrate how these technologies are already transforming industries. I hope to acquire practical skills in dataset preparation, model training, and deployment in realistic environments. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into mainstream technology, 
									understanding how these models operate and can be embedded into applications will be a major advantage in my career. I believe the instructor will guide us with valuable insights into advanced ML topics, allowing me to confidently apply them to real-world problems. Ultimately, I want to learn how to design intelligent systems that enhance functionality and drive innovation in the IT industry. 
									With AI playing a growing role across all sectors, this subject is crucial in preparing me to compete and contribute meaningfully in the professional world.

									<h2><strong><center>Topics</center></strong></h2>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										For the first topic we were refreshed on the topics of ITC C506 we talked about the basics when it comes to machine learning and what is Deep learning. 
										In this first topic Dr. Rodolfo Raga explained how AI works and what are its effects in the industry of IT, then we proceed what is machine learning and its types through the type we then proceeded 
										on the training process of machine learning  and the explanation of Deep Learning and its nature.
									</p>

									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										For the second topic we talked NLP Text preprocessing this topic showed how to process text based data set this topic shows the common data collection, overview steps involving NLP and text preprocessing pipeline. 
										Text preprocessing consists of lower casing – Special Character Removal – Stopword Removal – Tokenization this is commonly done in order to clean the dataset and use it for machine learning data with 
										unprocessed data set it can lead to low output for the models so it is important to properly processed the data in order to create usable machine learning the has a good output.
									</p>

									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										The next topic Introduces Natural Language Processing or NLP this topic shows words representation by using NLP we the machine learning can understand each words in the text based dataset just like the second 
										we need to preprocess the data before we implement Text Representation which will help the model understand the words. With text representation it has three text representation techniques that one will count the frequency, 
										while the other understand the weight of the word and the last will find the position of the text in the sentence in the dataset.
									</p>

									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										The third topic explains the application of NLP applications in real world applications. it shows that NLP can be used when it comes to understanding sentence’s meaning and text classification which can be applied on social media 
										monitoring for Sentiment Analysis, chatbots on Question learning, language translation on Machine Translation, and lastly conversion of spoken words to written text for Speech to text. All of this can be done through 
										the application of NLP with the right training and dataset NLP can basically do all the thing mentioned.
									</p>

									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										The last topic for the prelims is named entity recognition or NER we were introduced to spacy a free open source python library that is use for NLP, a development focused library it is designed to process large amount of text volumes 
										to be later used by models. The processing pipeline consist of Tokenizer - Tagger - Parser - NER - … - Doc, with the use of the whole pipeline we can apply depending on the situation can turn a noisy raw dataset text into a structured 
										ready to use data.
									</p>
									<h2><strong><center>Exercises</center></strong></h2>

									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										The First exercise was meant to create a E-portfolio to see our progress as the school year progresses. In this exercise I created a website that will hold all the topics, activities, quizzes, and exam that I will per terms, every end 
										of the term I will post the said objects in this website to be checked by our professor. I used a Simple Php web development kit for the website and add few things in the layout and design to make it my own.
									</p>
									<img src="images/exer1.png" alt="Machine Learning" style="width: 50%; max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />	
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										In the second exercise we were tasked to understand the process of preprocessing a text base data in NLP, this gave us a glimpse of working in a realworld user generated data in my instance the data is about game review. We followed a well structured 
										pipeline made by our professor but I add a step where in the data has URL base text so I created an instance to remove the said URLs transforming a noisy and unprocessed data into cleaned and noise-free ready to use data. The activity taught me the 
										importance of preprocessing because with unprocessed data the model will badly perform and create unwanted output, but by processing the data the model can yield a wanted result and perform good results.
									</p>
									<img src="images/exer2.png" alt="Machine Learning" style="width: 50%; max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										In the third exercise we were tasked to understand the different text representation techniques can be applied for the NLP that will then be converted to structured numerical data. In my understanding by applying Bag-of-Words, and 
										Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) we can set up the data for model use by turning text data into a numerical cleaned formed ready for models to use, the method has a special way of turning them into numerical format each of the methods 
										has a different perception when it comes to trade-offs between simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency. This activity shows me that the three methods used in this activity has their own use case scenario they have their own strengths and weaknesses 
										but thoroughly useful to the different industries that is applicable to them.
									</p>
									<img src="images/exer3.png" alt="Machine Learning" style="width: 50%; max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										For the last activity of the preliminary period we were tasked to understand the importance of NER model in a organized and carful way. This evaluation how the model functioned well in an entity commonality such as place but perform inconsistent when it 
										comes to categories like numbers. From what I learned the activity showed that the behavior of the model varies depending on different data and improved its performance by proper tuning and preprocessing.
									</p>
									<h2><strong><center>Exams</center></strong></h2>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										The exam consists of three questions, the first question was for our quiz, and the remaining questions are the exam itself. For the first question which is the quiz we were asked what the challenges were on getting the “golden standard data” 
										and the exam question that consist of two questions which is the importance of preprocessing for bag of words and the last question is the new NLP technique learned while we were doing the activities. In the first question I emphasized that 
										language was one of the challenges and the continued preprocess to achieve the golden standard for the dataset in order to achieve the standard the data must be continuously processed to achieve it and if the language is also include the process 
										is mostly doubled since we need to tune it before we continue. As for the first exam question, the gist of what I wrote is that the preprocess is important because an unprocessed data can yield to low performing model but with proper preprocess 
										it can yield good results and high-performance outcomes. And lastly for the last question since the dataset that I used had some URLs I have to add another technique to remove the URLs in the dataset so I create a process to remove them.
									</p>
									<h2><strong><center>Learning Reflection</center></strong></h2>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										During this term we were taught the basics of processing text based data and its importance. I should take account the output of model is based on how the data is processed, if I were to used and unprocessed data and feed it to a model the expected 
										output would be and underperforming model with an unfavorable output but with the proper preprocessing and technique application the model will perform great and will yield a favorable output. Also I need to further understand the use of the first 
										model we used this term which is NER because the paper that I wrote seems to be rushed and understudied.
